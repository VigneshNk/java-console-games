A repository of java console games I made in highschool.

## 1. Two Player Checkers

Two players take turns making moves and playing checkers against eachother. Game consists of complex error checking to ensure both player follow the rules and do not make illegal moves.

## 2. Minesweeper

Randomly generates 10 mines on field and allows user to reveal 8 different squares. User must then traverse from start position to end position with a maximum of 3 lives.
